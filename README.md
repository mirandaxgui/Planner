## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main repositories:

2. **Backend**: Contains the RESTful API supporting the application's features. It was developed with Java and Spring Boot and uses a PostgreSQL database for data storage.

## CI/CD

The *Planner* uses **GitHub Actions** to implement a continuous integration and delivery process, automating testing and deployment for both the frontend and backend.

- **Frontend**: Deployed automatically to Vercel after each merge into the main branch.
- **Backend**: Deployed to AWS EC2 using Docker images created during the GitHub Actions workflow.
